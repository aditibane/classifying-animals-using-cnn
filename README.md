# Stock Price Prediction
This model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans. 
The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. I have included these cutting-edge deep learning methods in this project.
In this part we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price.
